### Crier

```
[p]say #channel_name Howdy, @user! ðŸ¤ 
[p]shout #channel_name Anno 2077
```

**Say** accepts any character including emojis, **Shout** only accepts latin characters or numbers as it converts your words into regional indicator symbols which are nice big, blue, and bold letters using Discord's emoji set (:regional_character_a: :four: for example)

### Insult

```
[p]insult @user
```

Fetches random insult from https://market.mashape.com/Lakerolmaker/insult-generator and makes sure the user runs away crying!

### Killer

```
[p]slap @user
[p]punch @user
[p]stab @user
[p]shoot @user
[p]love @user
[p]sex @user
[p]succ @user
```

Each action has a low chance of either missing the target or critical hit ðŸ˜‰, also, trying to it the bot has severe consequences! ðŸ˜±

### Penis

```
[p]penis @user
[p]penis @user1 @user2 @user3 etc
```

Convertion of the original TwentySix cog for V2.
